# FizzBuzz TDD Kata

Keepler FizzBuzz TDD Kata.

In this workshop we will implement FizzBuzz algorithm using the TDD development procedure. This is a incremental 
iterative procedure that consist on write a tests first, based on requirements, followed by the implementation of the 
minimum amount of code needed to that test to pass. Finally the procedure allow for a refactor of the code (source code
and test code) to eliminate redundancies, commit to higher standards, etc. 

The following image resume this process:

Also you can found documentation about this procedure [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

## Current step

### Write a test that fails?
We are unable to find a test that fails based on requirements. We could pass over every number until 100 and all cases 
are now covered. So instead we opt to do a final refactor.
