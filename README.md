# FizzBuzz TDD Kata

Keepler FizzBuzz TDD Kata.

In this workshop we will implement FizzBuzz algorithm using the TDD development procedure. This is a incremental 
iterative procedure that consist on write a tests first, based on requirements, followed by the implementation of the 
minimum amount of code needed to that test to pass. Finally the procedure allow for a refactor of the code (source code
and test code) to eliminate redundancies, commit to higher standards, etc. 

The following image resume this process:

## Next steps
We have reached the end of this practical exercise on TDD. We hope you have been a helpful showing how to use the TDD 
technique. Some steps that could be followed after this exercise are:

### Error control
We have only focused on the requirements, that is, we only focus on the expected behavior of the algorithm. It would be 
interesting to add some control routine for unexpected behaviors, such as exceptions and error messages.

### Specs change
The initial specifications may change, for example we could try to implement the algorithm taking into account that the 
words FIZZ and BUZZ are not immutable and can be customized before execution.
